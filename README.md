I am a problem solver who sees opportunity in most things. When the stakes are high, I roll for the hard six. I excel at communicating with others, whether it's in English or German. My diverse employment and education history are my biggest strengths. Whether it's an award for policy revision from the Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections, organizing donation drives for victims of domestic violence, or being granted an instructorship to teach and learn with others, I have always pursued new challenges and learning new skills. 
I've always enjoyed analyzing data, and I have recently pursued this passion by enrolling in the Tech Elevator Java coding bootcamp. I look forward to a career in professional problem solving.
